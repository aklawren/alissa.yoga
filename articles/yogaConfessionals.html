<p>"Anything going on in the body that you'd like to share?"</p>

<p>It's quite common that this is one of the first phrases a teacher uses to connect in practice.  The goal is to find out if there are injuries or other things going on in the body or mind that might show up and should be tended to during practice -- like a tweaky knee, sore wrists, pregnancy, or an especially crazy day.</p>

<p>More often than not, people are reluctant to say anything even if their back or knees are aching as they wait for the teacher to change the topic.  This hesitancy is why I've of my teachers playfully (and aptly) calls this moment "yoga confessionals", a time to get something off your chest.</p>

<p>It can feel intimidating to list off the aches, pains, or struggles that you've been dealing with throughout the day and especially in front of a bunch of strangers.</p>

<p>I get it.  <em>I feel the same way.</em></p>

<p>I admit it, I myself am shy about bringing up my back pain because, "I already know what to do" or my hip sensitivity because "I can't quite describe it and it feels okay right now".</p>

<p>But acknowledging what's really going on with our body, breath, mind and then working with them instead of pretending they're not there is what yoga is all about!</p>

<p>It's also the moment if my own classes that I treasure the most.   Talking about the real things going on in our bodies that effect us every single day.</p>

<p>Cultivating the curiosity and attentiveness around the way we move throughout life is what I love the most about yoga.</p>

<p>Sure, flexible hamstrings and strong shoulders are nice, but uing the time in the mat to help explore, adjust, and inform how we carry ourselves off the mat is the real prize to be won.</p>

<p>I know the value, I truly _believe_ in it, yet I haven't been doing it in my own practice.</p>

<p>I'm setting an intention right now to speak up, and say what's going on (there's always something) to openly start the connection from my mat to my life.</p>

<p>Maybe it'll spark that conversation and connection for someone else too. :)</p>

<p>This week's <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f77leSlCU7vAAhZ5nchndpuksKrQW5oyo435DpF0rGM/edit?usp=sharing>Core Connection</a> practice lights up the core and gives room to discover the areas that might need some extra attention.</p>

<p>If you're practicing along at home, you might also practice speaking up (even just to yourself!) about what's going on and really tend to it as you move.</p>

<p>To those who attended the free class this week, you rock!  Keep that mind body connection going.  :)</p>

<p>Namaste</p>

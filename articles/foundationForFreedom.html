<p> Yoga traditionally was a practice done by a select few, usually far off in the mountains somewhere in isolation from “normal” society.  These yogi’s were on a path to find true enlightenment -- the ultimate freedom. </p>

<p> While today’s yoga is typically centered around the physical practice, or asana, there’s still a way to apply the original teachings to our modern lives today.  For me, this has meant finding freedom in my body -- not necessarily touching my feet to my head, but  in the form of functional movements that support my life.  </p>

<p> Many of the foundational alignment and philosophical principles in yoga help cultivate finding that freedom over time. One of the most influential practices for me personally has been svadhyaya, or self-study. </p>

<p> As a anxious, type-A, that wants to do everything the “right” way I’ve spent a lot of time doing things that I thought were correct instead of actually noticing how they felt or played out in my actual body.  For instance, I exercised regularly, and spent my hours at the office at a standing desk yet I still suffered from major low back pain that would majorly impact my ability to even exercise, walk, or even sleep normally. </p>

<p> Eventually, I had to let my stubborn perception that I was doing all that I could to better my health and start actually looking at the more subtle aspects of what was working for me vs. against me.  I found out that despite a superficially strong abs, I had almost no connection to my pelvic floor and transverse abdominals, the deepest core muscles that wrap all the way around and protect the low spine. </p>

<p> I’m still constantly working to bring attention and engagement to this area throughout my yoga asana practice, during the work day, while I’m in transit, anywhere really!  Although it’s still a work in progress, I’ve finally found a little bit of freedom to move, sit, play, and just live without feeling the constant anxiety around this tender area. </p>

<p> My hope in teaching yoga is to be able to help support people on their own practice of self-study that ultimately supports a little bit more ease and freedom in their own life.

<p> To support finding this freedom within yourself, feel free to follow this week’s <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHe0I8Q3RcRbKMNenHiDL2WQ9toOB24JDrvwIAes2XA/edit?usp=sharing'>Foundation for Freedom sequence</a> or join in this week’s free class in the park. :)

<p> I’ll meet you on the mat! </p>
